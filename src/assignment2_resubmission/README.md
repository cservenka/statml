The code for this handin has only been tested with Python v. 2.7.x - it will likely not work with Python 3.

The code uses matplotlib for rendering graphs and plots, as well as numpy for various vector/matrix operations.

Both of these libraries have dependencies of their own but are easily installed using pip or similar.

To run the entire set of scripts in one go simply invoke 'python main.py'.

The code for assignment II.1.1, II.1.2, II.2.1, II.2.2 and II.2.3 depends upon the data-files from the handout being present at a hardcoded location relative to the script itself.
