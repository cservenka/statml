The code for this handin has only been tested with Python v. 2.7.x - it will likely not work with Python 3.

The code numpy for various vector/matrix operations and sci-kit learn for SVM computations.

Both of these libraries have dependencies of their own but are easily installed using pip or similar.

To run the entire set of scripts in one go simply invoke 'python main.py'.

The code depends upon the data-files from the handout being present at a hardcoded location relative to the script itself.
